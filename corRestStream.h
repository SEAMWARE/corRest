// events (text/event-stream) are this. Both HTTP servers: the built-in one streams through corHttp's
// stream (corHttpResponseStream), libmicrohttpd through a content reader, the connection suspended
// while there is nothing to send. Built with COR_WITH_STREAM=1 (the default); 0 leaves the code out,
// and corRestStreamResponse says false.
